Algiz is a web application that allows users to create/upload and share resources online and access them from anywhere. Analogous to Google Docs, with Algiz you can create a document instantly or upload a document (if itâ€™s already created using another source), edit/modify it and share it.
Algiz aims to provide a quick and fast way of sharing resources (videos, images, text files, CODE) online.

*Note: For programmers who want to share code, Algiz has a Code Editor special for writing code. Most programming & mark-up languages are supported.*

#Support
Algiz uses a few HTML5 technologies e.g. Local Storage, Web Sockets etc. Since IE 6 is the one that introduced the execCommand() function to allow editable docs, technically speaking, Algiz should work on IE 6 and above. *However I haven't yet implement support for any IE browser*
- Chrome 
- Safari
- Firefox 3.6+
- Opera
- IE 6+ (No support yet)
